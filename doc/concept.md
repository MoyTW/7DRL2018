# One-Sentence Summary

Defend your domain from adventuring parties by skirmishing and harrying them
through your multi-level dungeon.

# Concept

The aim of this game is to give the player the feeling of being a powerful,
singular hunter fighting a group of dangerous foes.

Gameplay targets:

1. Reward planning and tailoring your approach towards your foes
2. Allow minor victories and setbacks as part of a long engagement
3. Reward judicious and well-timed usage of resources

# Proposals:

## Extremely strong resistences, and common resist+ items/skills/spells (1)

To force the user to use different tools against different foes.

## Powerful items and spell slots (1, 3, 4)

3 because consumables can be exhausted, so you can "trade" consumables favorably
or unfavorably, and since they're powerful it's important!

## Temporary damage systems (2, 3)

I'm thinking something like PoE's Stamina/Health split, where if you can deplete
Stamina you can get cause serious injury while still allowing future combats. It
seems like a pretty good way to transform traditional systems into attritional
systems.

## Timed conditions (1, 2)

Could be anything from "Take damage while on the floor" to DD's light system,
where you get stronger/weaker depending on the usage of those resources. The
point of this would be to force engagements or action.

## Morale/Panic mechanics (1, 2)

Allows you to "beat" them (scatter them) while still not actually yet beating
them. A possible issue in that once they do break and scatter, that would almost
definitely be a foregone conclusion from there.

## Free in-between wave respecs and wide variety of skills (1)

This is to encourage you to vary up your builds.

# Systems

## Your Dungeon

Your dungeon is definitely a multi-level dungeon, with each different level
having a different gimmick. Whether these gimmicks are user-chosen or fixed or
random, I'm not sure, but each gimmick should be unique enough to open up
gameplay opportunities.

Possible gimmicks:
+ No spellcasting/reduced magic effectiveness
+ Constant damage of a specific type
+ Morale penalties
+ Straight stat penalties
+ Reduced LOS
+ Infinitely spawning popcorn
+ Elite guardians

### Scrying Report

You should get a good idea of what would be sane to bring. Maybe not 100%
information, but things like classes, weapon types, obvious items, and other
things you should take into account.

### Preparation Phase

You get to respec here.

## Adventurer Waves

Adventurers attack in waves of 2-8 adventurers at a time.
